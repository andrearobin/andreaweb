                <h2>About me</h2>

                <p>
                    I blend people, process, technology and products to develop opportunities for sales, savings, and solutions. My clients are in the retail, consumer packaged goods, real estate, insurance, healthcare, and entertainment industries. They range from mid-size to Fortune 500 organizations that operate globally.
                </p>

                <p>
                    I consider myself detail-oriented, but I can also see and negotiate within the frame of the big picture. This allows me to devise technical and managerial solutions to the most intricate problems, without losing sight of the larger goals at hand.
                </p>

                <p>
                    I aim to build high performing organizations that shape the future, especially ones that upend a market or define a new one. I believe this reinvention is the essence of economic growth.
